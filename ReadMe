I went through your comments and added most of it. 
I added scaffolding to both the Patron table and the concerts because I wanted to streamline the data collection. 
I also added sort, search, and page on the patron page. For the patrons visits, I added a * for each visit they had. It's not practical in the long run but it's a starting place. 
The user can add, delete or edit both concerts and patrons. 
I decided to just go with cards on the concert page instead of a carousel on the homepage because I actually want to try and use this and I know my coworkers would prefer the simplicity.
